## Problem 1 : Solving systems of ODEs
You are given an Isothermal Plug Flow Reactor in which components A and C are fed in equimolar amounts, and the follow- ing reaction takes place
$2 A \to B$, with $C$ as a third non-reacting component.
You assume that the reaction takes place in the liquid phase and that the volumetric flow rate remains constant even when reaction occurs.

The equations for all three species in the plug flow reactor are:

$u \dfrac{dC_i}{dz} =r_j$, j = 1,...,3

For A, B, C these equations become:

$u \dfrac{dC_A}{dz} =âˆ’2\cdot k C^2_A$,

$u \dfrac{dC_B}{dz} = + k C^2_A$, 

$u \dfrac{dC_C}{dz} =0$

$C_A$ (0) = 2 kmol/m3, $C_B$ (0) = 0, $C_C$ (0) = 2 kmol/m^3
and we take u = 0.5 m/s, k = 0.3 m^3/kmol s, and the total reactor length as z = 2.4 m.

Find and plot:

$C_A(z), C_B(z), C_C(z)$

## Problem 2: 1st order reaction in CSTR in adiabatic case

For CSTR:
$F_{out} - F_{in} = rV$
$F = Q C$

When the volumetric flow rates are constant, equations above become

$Q(C_{out}- C_{in}) = rV$, which is the mass balance for a CSTR. 

A similar equation can be written as an energy balance. This example considers a CSTR in which a first-order reaction occurs,

but the temperature also changes owing to the heat of reaction. The equations to be
solved are:
$\frac{Q}{V_R}  (1 - C) = k(T) C = C e^{\gamma (1 - 1/T)}$, since $k(T) = e^{\gamma (1 - 1/T)}$

$\frac{Q}{V_R}  (1 - T) =  \beta C e^{\gamma (1 - 1/T)}$

The left-hand sides are the flow rate times a concentration or temperature difference between the input and output, divided by the volume. The equations have been normalized by the inlet concentration and temperature. The right-hand sides are the rate of reaction and the rate of energy generation due to reaction, respectively.
The case described above is for an adiabatic reactor. When the reactor is adia- batic, the equations can be combined by multiplying the first equation by b and adding it to the second equation; then the right-hand side vanishes:

$(1-c)/(1-T) = \frac{1}{\beta}$

$\beta(1-C) - (1-T) = 0 $

This equation can be solved for T:

$T = \beta(C-1) + 1$

Now the mass balance can be considered a single equation in one unknown:

$Q/V_R (1 - \beta(C-1) - 1) = \beta C e^{\gamma (1 - 1/T)}$

## Problem 3 (Bonus)

Solve $\dfrac{dy}{dt}=f(y,t)$, $y(0)=y_0$, with N_points=40 steps until t=time_finish=10.

$f(y, t) = -2 \cdot y$

1. Calculate and plot the analytical solution to this ODE (with black solid line 'k-')

2. Solve the ODE using the simple Forward Euler scheme. Plot it using red dashed line ('r--')
```python
    t[k+1] = t[k] + dt
    y[k+1] = y[k] + dt*f(y[k], t[k])
```

3. Solve the equation using Runge-Kutta method:

```python
    t[k+1] = t[k] + dt
    y_star = y[k] + dt*f(y[k], t[k])
    y[k+1] = y[k] + 0.5*dt*f(y[k], t[k]) + 0.5*dt*f(y_star, t[k+1])
```

## Problem 4: Data regression

1. Fit the data using $y(x) = A \cdot x^{\alpha}$.
2. Print the parameters A, $\alpha$ that provide the best fit. 
3. Plot the data points with circles and the fitted curve with a solid line
4. Calculate the $\chi which is the squared difference between each data point and the predicted curve:

$$\chi^2 = \Sigma (data[i] - FittedCurve[i])^2$$
